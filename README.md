# SemiConductor-Company-Comparison
Excel-based benchmarking and correlation analysis of semiconductor companies using Power Query and data visualisation.

This project analyses leading semiconductor companies to identify competitive positioning and test whether higher R&D investment leads to stronger revenue growth. The tool combines automated data ingestion, statistical analysis, and visualisation to simulate a real-world benchmarking workflow used in financial and data analytics roles.

Project Objective:
To compare NVIDIA, AMD, and Intel using key performance metrics and determine: 
Which company demonstrates the strongest growth and profitability profile
Whether R&D spending correlates with revenue growth in the sector

Tools & Techniques Used

Excel Power Query for automated dataset ingestion
Correlation analysis using Excel formulas
Scatter chart visualisation for competitive positioning
Structured dataset modelling

Key Findings:
The correlation between R&D spending and revenue growth was weakly negative (~ -0.35)
This suggests that higher R&D investment does not immediately translate into faster growth
NVIDIA currently leads the sector in both growth and profitability metrics
